# radio_ids.yaml
# Defines the radio ID(s) to be used with this radio.
# Radio ID and Name are pretty self explanatory.
# Abbrev needs some explanation.
# We are a two ham family, and we will be sharing the radio.
# Since the IDs are associated with channels, this means that all the channels
# have to be duplicated, one for each ID.  The idea is to populate "his and her"
# (in our case) zones, containing the channels for one ID or the other.
# The Abbrev(iation) will be prefixed to the zones, to distinguish them.
# A single letter is suggested, but not enforced.
#
# Radio ID and Name are exported into the csv file RadioIDList.CSV.
