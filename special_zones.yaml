# special_zones.yaml
# All channels are automatically put into a zone named for the repeater
# used.  All simplex channels are automatically put into a zone named
# "Simplex".
# This file is used to specify channels that go into other zones, for
# instance to put "core" simplex channels, e.g., 146.52 and 446.0, into
# all zones.
